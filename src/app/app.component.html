              'Hello, My Name is Ntokozo Qwabe I'm a third-year BSc Information Technology student from the North-West University.
              Though my experience these past three years I have gained experience the may languages such as python, C#, java and javascript.
              I have also gained a liking for both front-end and back-end programming, with me like to make sure that both my user interface is appealing to users and making sure that the app runs smoothly for the user. I also like learning new technologies such as angular which I'm currently using for this CV
              and I also like working with others often learning from them too as IT is a big field and so there is always more to learn from both your co-workers.'
